"
The 4-Queens Problem consists of placing four queens on a 4 x 4 chessboard so that no two queens can capture each other. 
That is, no two queens are allowed to be placed on the same row, the same column or the same diagonal.

Although this particular problem isnâ€™t very impressive, keep in mind that you can generalize it to n x n chessboards with n >= 4.
